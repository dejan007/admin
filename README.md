Admin Panel

This project is made using ReactJS and NextJS from scratch. 

The idea was to create a frontend for a simple admin panel (a dashboard) for a blog-type website.
I did not use many external libraries, only MaterialsUI for tables and icons, and ReCharts for charts.

There are 6 routes and several React components that are highly reusable and customizable.
